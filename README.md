# Project-Plan-Agent

# Problem Statement
Project managers often receive Statements of Work (SoWs) in unstructured formats
like PDFs or Word documents, making it difficult to quickly identify key phases,
timelines, and task breakdowns. ​

Manually extracting this information is time-consuming, error-prone, and delays
project planning and monitoring. This creates challenges in establishing clear
accountability, tracking project progress, and identifying potential risks early.​

# Business Solution
The SoW Analyzer leverages Generative AI and document intelligence to automatically process SoWs and extract structured data such as project phases, timelines, tasks, and subtasks. ​
This data is presented in a downloadable Excel format, providing project managers with a ready-to-use task list that can be directly integrated into their planning and monitoring tools.​
The Streamlit-based user interface ensures a seamless, interactive experience for uploading documents and reviewing extracted insights.​

# Outcome
By automating the SoW analysis process, project managers can save hours of manual effort and begin planning immediately after contract finalization.​

This solution improves project visibility, enhances tracking accuracy, and supports proactive risk management. Ultimately, it leads to better project execution, higher client satisfaction, and reduced administrative overhead.​
